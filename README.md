# My-First-Assembly-Program
My first assembly program on the Mano Basic Computer to add two numbers with picture of the ram after the run
# Mano Assembly – Add Two Numbers

This is my first assembly language program written for the Mano Basic Computer Simulator.

## 🧠 Function
The program adds two numbers (A + B) and stores the result in memory.

## 💾 Data
- A = 5
- B = 7
- SUM = Result → 12

## ▶️ Usage
Run the code using `mano-simulator.jar` and watch the result stored in `SUM`.

## 💡 Learning Goal
To understand how `LDA`, `ADD`, and `STA` work in the Mano instruction set.
